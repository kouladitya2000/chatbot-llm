      "Question: What is cricket?\n",
      "Answer: Sure! Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the center of which is a 22-yard (20-meter) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The objective of the game is to score as many runs as possible while also trying to dismiss the opposing team. \n",
      "\n",
      "The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets. The fielding side tries to prevent this by preventing the ball from leaving the field and getting the ball to either wicket to dismiss each batter. Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. \n",
      "\n",
      "When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends, and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information. Forms of cricket range from Twenty20 (also known as T20), with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs, and the game generally lasting three to four hours, to Test matches played over five days.\n"
